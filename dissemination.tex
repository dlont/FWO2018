The Large Hadron Collider is one of the largest scientific instruments that was ever built. Its research program is mainly focused on the searches for new phenomena and achievements of the LHC are widely known. Besides providing unique information to the scientific community, I believe that LHC became a cultural symbol for scientific curiosity and dedication. I am very enthusiastic about the opportunity to communicate scientific results to general audience and, especially, as a professional researcher, to encourage young individuals to study science. In this respect, several activities targeted at high-school and university students are planned. The VUB regularly organises infodays delivered in English for international Master students, in order to get acquainted with professors, visit laboratories and get to know to students life, therefore the participation in such or similar events is planned during the mandate.
