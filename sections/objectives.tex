With this project \textbf{I plan to perform direct search for BSM processes in events with $\pmb{t\bar{t}t\bar{t}}$ signature  as well as measure four top quark production in $pp$ collisions with the CMS detector at the LHC at centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 and 14 TeV.} The SM measurement aims at testing the state-of-the-art perturbative QFT predictions~\cite{Bevilacqua:2012em,Frederix:2017wme} while direct searches seek for BSM signal. As described above, there is a certain class of models predicting significantly larger than SM cross section values and resonances~\cite{Lillie:2007hd, Gregoire:2011ka, Pomarol:2008bh}, thus making direct test of such models at the LHC feasible in the RUN 2 for which, in total, more than 150 fb$^{-1}$ of the integrated luminosity are expected. The discovery of significant deviation from the SM predictions may have a major impact on the field, while the converse will help to restrict possible BSM scenarios. The recently published constraints from $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV data for SM four top production at ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2017faq} and CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2017tep}, to one of which I have made a leading contribution,
%~\cite{Aad:2015kqa,Khachatryan:2014sca} 
resulted in 60 and 69 fb 95\% CL upper limits on the production cross section, respectively. The study~\cite{Sirunyan:2017roi} reported the first observation of $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production in multilepton channel. In this study small excess, although consistent with SM predictions, was observed. However, the measurement features about 80\% uncertainty on the measured cross section and is still dominated by statistical component.

The previous analysis at CMS in single-lepton and opposite sign dilepton channels made use of 2.3 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, that is about 20 signal events for the complete 2015 dataset. \textbf{I plan to analyse full data sample collected in 2016--2018 to improve statistical and systematic accuracy of the search}. These datasets will significantly increase the sensitivity to the processes with four top quarks.}

\textcolor{\mycolor}{
Examples of leading order (LO) SM and corresponding BSM Feynman diagrams for $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:LOtttt}. The reconstruction of this process is especially challenging because such final state is characterised by large hadronic activity, $\hight$, and incorporates four b-quarks, jets or leptons from $W$-decays and additional jets from initial and/or final-state QCD radiation. In addition, such events have non-vanishing missing momentum in case of semileptonic $W$-decays, which is understood in top physics. Bottom quarks are identified exploiting the properties of the weak decays of $B$-hadrons, which are typically formed from $b$'s during the hadronisation stage. These hadrons have relatively long mean lifetime of the order of 10$^{-12}$s and travel several millimeters from the production point before they decay giving rise to displaced tracks. Depending on the decay channel of $W$-bosons, several possible combinations of jet and lepton multiplicities can be identified in \fourtop events e.g. final states with a single muon $\left(\mu\right)$+jets or a single electron $\left(e\right)$+jets\footnote{In the following, charged first and second generation leptons, i.e. $e/\mu$ are generically denoted by $l$.} arising promptly from $W$ decays or in a cascade $W\rightarrow\tau\nu_\tau$, $\tau\rightarrow l\nu_l \nu_\tau$. This final state has the highest probability ($\approx 41\%$) of occurrence, while zero-leptons, two-leptons or three- and four-leptons have 30\%, 22\% and 6\% odds, respectively~\cite{Khachatryan:2014sca}. Vanishing $\misspt$ in the all-hadronic channel as well as the capability to reconstruct the momentum of the neutrino\footnote{The SM decay hypothesis of the $W$ boson has to be assumed} in the single-lepton channel, increases the sensitivity to BSM models without undetectable particles carrying significant momentum. This signature makes this proposal \textbf{unique as no similar analyses, besides ongoing effort of the applicant and the hosting group, are currently being performed by the CMS collaboration, allowing ownership and visibility}.}

\textcolor{\mycolor}{
Several principal challenges inherent to the explored final state can be identified early on. 
%An efficient $b$-tagging algorithm with high discriminating power at high jet multiplicity is crucial for selection of four top events and suppression of overwhelming background, mostly comprised of $t\bar{t}jj$ production, where $jj$ denotes a pair of light-flavour\footnote{Jets originating from $u,d,s,g$ partons are generically called light-flavour jets.} or $c$-quark jets, or associated electroweak-boson production. The CMS collaboration relies on well established algorithms~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua} for this task. However, their settings were optimised for the physics environment of $\sqrt{s}=7(8)$ TeV runs~\cite{CMS:2013vea}, whereas due to increased energy and pile-up in RUN2, their performance may not be optimal anymore. Besides the pile-up effect, $b$-tagging may also be affected by the complex multijet signature of the proposed signal. Thus, \textbf{investigation and optimisation of $b$-tagging performance} in the complex $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ environment at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13(14) TeV is envisaged in this project. These results can be later used in other analyses with similar event signatures. 
A difficulty persistent to the reconstruction of multiple top quarks is identification of a correct combination of final state objects arising from a common mother-particle decay. For example, in the single-lepton channel, $4!\cdot C_6^2 \cdot C_4^2 = 2160$, where $C_n^k$ denotes binomial coefficient, possible assignments of four $b$-jets and six light-flavour jets to four top quarks exist. In order to suppress combinatorial background, decay products kinematic information can be used, e.g. combinations with invariant masses outside $W$-boson and top-quark mass windows can be rejected. Furthermore, MVA techniques can be applied to enhance classification power of assignment algorithm. The \textbf{improvement in the top-decay reconstruction} will have a significant impact on the signal sensitivity and background suppression.}
