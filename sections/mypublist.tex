\textbf{I am a co-author of more than 153 publications as a member of the CMS, ZEUS and CDF collaborations. These publications have on average 36 citations (per paper) and overall h-index  $h_\mathrm{HEP}=27$.} Moreover, for the contribution to the maintenance of the CMS Monte Carlo simulations production system I am be included in the CMS author list starting from 8 February 2016.

By convention, articles published by particle physics experiments list all collaboration members as authors in strict alphabetical order. This policy reflects the substantial efforts in detector construction and maintenance, data acquisition, data reconstruction and calibration that all collaborators contribute to and which is a prerequisite to any data analysis. This is particularly relevant for those who have committed a substantial fraction of their time to construction, installation and commissioning of detectors. As such, scientific leadership, which is awarded after selection on merits and excellence within the collaboration, as are conference presentations, and seminar invitations 
add a reliable additional measure of scientific productivity in the hep-ex field than merely citations alone.  The complete list of my publications is available from \url{http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+a+lontkovskyi&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0}

\textbf{In 2016 I was invited as a referee for journal \textbf{Phys.Lett.B} (Impact factor 4.787).}
