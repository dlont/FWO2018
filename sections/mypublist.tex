\textbf{I am a co-author of more than 69 publications as a member of the ZEUS and CDF collaborations. These publications have on average 37.9 citations (per paper) and overall h-index  $h_\mathrm{HEP}=25$.} Moreover, for the contribution to the maintenance of the CMS Monte Carlo simulations production system I will be included in the CMS author list starting from 8 February 2016.

Because of extreme level of sophistication of experimental setups and corresponding analysis infrastructure which can only be successfully operated by large multi-national collaborations, all members of the collaboration receive equal credit for particular publication, although listed in alphabetical order. For academic record purposes, however, the contribution of typically small group of researchers performing the actual analysis of experimental data is usually emphasised. The complete list of my publications is available from \url{http://inspirehep.net/search?ln=en&ln=en&p=find+a+lontkovskyi&of=hb&action_search=Search&sf=earliestdate&so=d&rm=&rg=25&sc=0}

\textbf{In 2016 I was invited as a referee for journal \textbf{Phys.Lett.B} (Impact factor 4.787).}
