The Gantt chart (allocated time interval and estimated risk) for the envisaged WPs and corresponding subtasks is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:gantt_new}. The publication procedures are not included into the chart because of the specific nature of the publication policy in the CMS collaboration. In general, the foreseen journal articles will be prepared in parallel to the outlined active stages of research. The estimated effort includes service work to qualify as a CMS author, which amounts to 3 month/year.

The extend of the color bands indicates the start and the end of corresponding task, while their colour encodes the risk estimate (Green---low risk, Orange---medium risk, Red---high-risk). In this figure, EFT --- effective field theory.}
