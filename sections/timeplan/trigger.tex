To select candidate \fourtop events on-line, different existing CMS trigger paths will be used depending on the decay channel in focus. Thus, for example, dedicated single-muon and single-electron triggers can be utilised for $l$+jets channel, while the $ll$+jets selection can take the advantage of existing di-lepton triggers. Presence of a $b$-jet can be possibly included to the High-Level trigger requirements also. For the all-hadronic \fourtop channel no dedicated triggers exist, however, the applicability of CMS multi-jet and high-$\hight$ trigger chains developed for SUSY analyses can be explored, otherwise a\textbf{ dedicated trigger path will be designed} for the 2017--2018 running phase. In case such a trigger configuration will be developed, one can benefit from tunning the trigger specifically to have high acceptance for \fourtop events, for example $p_T$ thresholds can be lowered while maintaining acceptable trigger rates. Well established techniques will be used to measure efficiencies and corresponding systematic uncertainties attributed to those triggers. I have \textbf{experience in both development and optimising new trigger} configuration as well as the measurements of existing trigger performance. Therefore this task is considered as having a \textbf{low risk} and is a natural starting point for further deployment of the analysis.
