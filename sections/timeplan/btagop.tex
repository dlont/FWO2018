After selecting suitable trigger chains and ensuring appropriate quality of selected final-state leptons and jets using off-line selection criteria, further restrictions on $b$- and light-flavour-jet multiplicity will be imposed to reduce the background from top-pair production associated with multiple jets. Any particular choice is always a trade-off between selection efficiency and purity of the data sample, and thus is subject to optimisation.

After imposing appropriate selection criteria on $b$-quark multiplicity, the remaining dominant background contribution will be due to \ttbb, for zero-leptons or single- and two-leptons channels, respectively. The production cross sections of \ttbb process is approximately two orders of magnitude larger~\cite{Bevilacqua:2014qfa} than that of \fourtop. For this reason, the next logical step would be to identify and reconstruct (additional) top decays.
