The modified frequentist $\mathrm{CL_s}$ approach~\cite{Junk:1999kv,Read:2002hq} can be used to assess the statistical significance of the signal in case of observation or to establish the limits on the mass and production cross section, as well as to combine results obtained in different channels. \textbf{This WP will build on the expertise of other researchers in the institution and strong collaboration with the authors of respective theoretical predictions and thus has potential risks.} The minimal goal of this WP is a top-down interpretation of the results of the searches within the framework of existing models, similarly to what has already been performed by the hosting group or within the framework of simplified models. A bottom-up approach would be the interpretation of the data using the EFT calculations. My experience with the MC generation together with cooperation with the phenomenology groups in Brussels is the perfect fit to complete this task in an effective manner.

The outcome of these findings will be \textbf{together with the experimental results} outlined above or in a \textbf{separate publication}.
